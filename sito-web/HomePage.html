                    <h3>Digital Currency Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        Digital currency is a form of currency that exists solely in electronic form, without any physical representation such as coins or banknotes. It operates through digital technologies like cryptography and blockchain.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <ul>

                        <div class="option">
                            <h4>Virtual Currency</h4>
                            <p>
                                Virtual currencies are typically used within virtual environments such as online games and virtual worlds.
                                They are created and managed by private companies and do not hold legal tender status in terms of traditional currency.
                                Examples include "coins" used in online games or virtual currencies within social media platforms.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>Cryptocurrency</h4>
                            <p>
                                Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital currency that utilizes cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new units.
                                Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be created, but now there are many others, such as Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.
                                Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and not regulated by a central authority like a central bank.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)</h4>
                            <p>
                                Central bank digital currencies are digital currencies issued and regulated by a national central bank.
                                Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are controlled by a central authority and may be considered a digital form of traditional government-issued currency.
                                CBDCs can be used for payment and fund transfer purposes, but they may also offer additional functionalities such as programmability and transaction traceability.
